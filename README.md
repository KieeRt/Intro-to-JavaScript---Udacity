# Intro-to-JavaScript---Udacity 2019
This is documentation and solved problems of Udacity's course [Intro to JavaScript](https://eu.udacity.com/course/intro-to-javascript--ud803)

I have done two sections:
### [Problems solved](https://github.com/KieeRt/Intro-to-JavaScript---Udacity/tree/master/Lesson%20N)
where i put all exercises and problems solved from course

### [Library](https://github.com/KieeRt/Intro-to-JavaScript---Udacity/tree/master/library)
where you can find explained all methods you need during course 

I hope this source can be useful during your way,
but anyway I suggest you trying to solve the problem by yourself and only when you have done all that you could, come here and see the answer.
